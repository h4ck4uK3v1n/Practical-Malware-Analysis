- Questions:
  - 1. Upload the Lab01-03.exe file to http://www.VirusTotal.com/. Does it match any existing antivirus definitions?
  - 2. Are there any indications that this file is packed or obfuscated? If so, what are these indicators? If the file is packed, unpack it if possible.
  - 3. Do any imports hint at this program’s functionality? If so, which imports are they and what do they tell you?
  - 4. What host- or network-based indicators could be used to identify this malware on infected machines?

## 1) VirusTotal Detections?

- File `Lab01-03.exe`:
  - **SHA256**: `7983a582939924c70e3da2da80fd3352ebc90de7b8c4c427d484ff4f050f0aec`.

## 2) Packed/Obfuscated?

- Use tools `Detect-It-Easy`:

  - File `Lab01-03.exe`: Packer: FSG(1.0)[-]
  - This is packed. The only imports table are `LoadLibrary` and `GetProcAddress`.

- FSG(1.0) unpacking: https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/Category:Digital-Forensics/Computer-Forensics/Anti-Reverse-Engineering/Packers/FSG

## 3) Import Directory Hints?

- The only imports table are used for unpacking.

  - KERNEL32.DLL
    - LoadLibraryA
    - GetProcAddress

## 4) Host/Network Based Indicators?

- Can't find anything useful, strings analysis shows OLE related contents.

```ps1
0000000011C5   0000004041C5      0   ole32.vd
0000000011F4   0000004041F4      0   }OLEAUTLA
```

- `OLEAUT32.DLL` is for OLE technologies. Header hashes? Can't get much more than that without going deeper.
