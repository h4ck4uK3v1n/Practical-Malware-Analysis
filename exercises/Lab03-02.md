> Analyze the malware found in the file Lab03-02.dll using basic dynamic analysis tools.

- Questions:
  - 1. How can you get this malware to install itself?
  - 2. How would you get this malware to run after installation?
  - 3. How can you find the process under which this malware is running?
  - 4. Which filters could you set in order to use procmon to glean information?
  - 5. What are the malwareâ€™s host-based indicators?
  - 6. Are there any useful network-based signatures for this malware?

## 1) How can it be installed?

- Found the export `Install` in the DLL. Ran the following command:

```ps1
rundll32.exe Lab03-02.dll, Install
```

- Run RegShot before and after, then compared. The results show that a service named `IPRIP` was added, specifically the new registry key `HKLM\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\IPRIP`.

```

- Verified that the service was installed using `psservice`:

```ps1
psservice query IPRIP

SERVICE_NAME: IPRIP
DISPLAY_NAME: Intranet Network Awareness (INA+)
Depends INA+, Collects and stores network configuration and location information, and notifies applications when this information changes.
        TYPE              : 20 WIN32_SHARE_PROCESS
        STATE             : 1  STOPPED
                               (NOT_STOPPABLE,NOT_PAUSABLE,IGNORES_SHUTDOWN)
        WIN32_EXIT_CODE   : 1077 (0x435)
        SERVICE_EXIT_CODE : 0  (0x0)
        CHECKPOINT        : 0x0
        WAIT_HINT         : 0 ms
```

## 2) How would it be run after installation?

- Started the service with the following command:

```ps1
net start IPRIP

    The Intranet Network Awareness (INA+) service is starting.
    The Intranet Network Awareness (INA+) service was started successfully.
```

## 3) How can the process be found?

- Had Process Explorer running when the service started. Searched for the string Lab03 in Process Explorer, and came up with the process svchost.exe (PID:1056). This instance of svchost.exe is also hosting other services, as evidenced by hovering over the process in Process Explorer.

## 4) Filters for ProcMon?

- Created a Process Monitor filter using the PID (1056) found in Process Explorer.

## 5) Host based indicators?

- 1. The DLL itself.
- 2. The IPRIP service (and associated registry keys).

## 6) Network based indicators?

- 1. DNS queries for `practicalmalwareanalysis.com`.
- 2. HTTP GET requests to `practicalmalwareanalysis.com/serve.html`.
- 3. HTTP request with user agent that includes the string `Windows XP 6.11`.
- 4. Packets to `80/tcp` that match the periodic transmissions' unchanging payload bytes.

- The service sends a DNS requests for `practicalmalwareanalysis.com`.

- Service sends a single HTTP GET request for `/serve.html`. The user agent was the system's hostname followed by `Windows XP 6.11`, a hardcoded string in the binary. Inetsim responds with default HTML response.

- Service then sends some small (54-62 byte) packets to `80/tcp`, of what look like random data. Each packet is only slightly different, and always in the same location. Custom protocol?

- The service does this at regular intervals. Identifying itself to a botnet as a zombie?
