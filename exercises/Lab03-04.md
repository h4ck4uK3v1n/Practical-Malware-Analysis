# Lab 03-04

> Analyze the malware found in the file Lab03-04.exe using basic dynamic analysis tools. (This program is analyzed further in the Chapter 9 labs.)

- Questions:
  - 1. What happens when you run this file?
  - 2. What is causing the roadblock in dynamic analysis?
  - 3. Are there other ways to run this program?

## 1) What happens when file is run?

- The program seemingly did nothing, then spawned a cmd.exe instance to delete itself on disk.

  - ProcExp: Nothing interesting.
  - RegShot: No registry modifications.
  - WireShark: No unusual activity.
  - ProcMon: 1783 events for process name `Lab03-04.exe`.
  - Created a process at the end to delete itself with the string: `"C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe" /c del C:\DOCUME~1\ADMINI~1\Desktop\Lab03-04.exe >> NUL`.

## 2) What is causing roadblock in dynamic analysis?

- The program deletes itself from the hard drive. Presumably, it's failing an environment check or missing an argument.

## 3) What other way can the program be run?

- With varying arguments. In a debugger.
